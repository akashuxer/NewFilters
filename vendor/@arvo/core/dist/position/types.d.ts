/**
 * Placement-flip strategy when the requested side does not fit the boundary.
 *
 * - `'main-axis'` (default) -- only flip to the OPPOSITE side on the same
 *   axis (top<->bottom or left<->right). The cross-axis cascade is skipped
 *   so a `bottom-start` panel that cannot fit below never jumps to
 *   `right-start`; instead it stays on the bottom (or flips to top) and
 *   relies on `maxHeight` clamping + internal scroll to fit. This is the
 *   correct behavior for anchored panels (popovers, dropdowns, menus,
 *   option-lists, pickers) where moving to the perpendicular axis is
 *   visually surprising for the user.
 * - `'any'` -- the historical behavior. After OPPOSITE, also try ADJACENT
 *   sides (perpendicular axis) before falling back to the best-by-score
 *   candidate. Used by `ArvoTooltip` and `ArvoRichTooltip` where moving to
 *   an adjacent side is explicitly part of the documented contract.
 *
 * `placement: 'auto'` ignores this option and enumerates every side
 * regardless (it is opt-in to any-side selection by design).

 *   geometry-only (depends on anchor + boundary, never on the float's
 *   current rendered size), so the result is stable across iterations.
 *
 * - `'float-size'` -- the FLOAT itself resized (e.g. its content swapped
 *   while it was open, like an action menu filter shrinking the item
 *   list). Consumers that opt into placement-locking treat this source
 *   as "do not re-resolve placement" and pin to the previously-resolved
 *   side, eliminating filter-induced flicker.
 *
 * Watchers always emit a single callback shape; consumers that don't
 * care about the source simply ignore the second argument.
